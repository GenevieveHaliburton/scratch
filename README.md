# HCA Scanpy Demo

## Installation

This notebook assumes that you have installed python 3 on your system, 
and that the `pip` executable installs packages for that python
distribution. For some users, it may be necessary to use `pip3` instead.

```bash
pip install -r ./REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

## Usage

Start up the jupyter kernel, which will open a web browser. You can then 
select the `hca_demo_scanpy.ipynb` notebook from the `Files` sidebar. 

```bash
jupyter lab
```
